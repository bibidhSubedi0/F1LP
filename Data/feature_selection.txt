Hypothesises (idk if it is a word)

Goal:
    During the grand prix, based on
        1. Telemetry
        2. Past laps
        3. Qualifying
        4. Prerace
    predict the softmax values for each driver's probability to win the race

Prerace features (Slightly difficult to obtain, idk if they are worth it, aile lekhdai ma k gai raxa)
    -> driver's average position on the track in last 10 years
    -> driver's status on team switch this season?
    -> driver's championship points before this race
    -> constructor's points before this race
    -> track type (street/permanent/hybrid)
    -> expected weather (rain, dry, mixed)

Qualifying Features
    -> Position
    -> Average of best 3 lap times? maybe idfk
    -> Rank in S1 S2 and S3 (idk if this is that big)
    -> Top speed at speed traps
    -> delta to pole position
    -> tire used for best lap (if available)

Past Laps from 0 to n
    -> Position
    -> Average Lap time (or some other better metric)
    -> Lap time variance (consistency)
    -> Number of pit stops
    -> time lost/gained in pits
    -> positions gained/lost since race start
    -> delta to leader
    -> time gap to car ahead and behind

Telemetry
    -> speed over lap
    -> throttle average and variance
    -> brake usage percentage
    -> DRS usage frequency
    -> gear shifts per lap
    -> steering angle variation (cornering stability?)
    -> relative X, Y, Z positions (could use to track sector behavior)
    -> micro deltas per sector (maybe by comparing to previous laps)


Manual feature pruning + PCA or just variance thresholding?
